<b>What inspired me to make this site?</b>
<br>
I've been making websites ranging from a simple html sites to websites using Semantic UI since elementary
 school. The design and intricacy of coding these sites has always interested me and I love how there are always ways
  to improve or make the site even better. Finally, I also really enjoy sharing pictures and articles about projects I
   have been working on.
