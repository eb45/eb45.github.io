  Hi, my name is Emma Bennett. I am a rising sophomore at NCS. I participate in Public Forum debate, Cyberpatriot
  , Cross-Country, and squash. In my free time, I love baking, reading mysteries or historical fiction, and taking
   photos :)

<b>What inspired me to make this site?</b>
<br>
I've been making websites ranging from a simple html sites to websites using Semantic UI since elementary
 school. The design and intricacy of coding these sites has always interested me and I love how there are always ways
  to improve or make the site even better. Finally, I also really enjoy sharing pictures and articles about projects I
   have been working on.

<br><br>
<b>What kind of posts would you expect in the future?</b>
<br>
Currently, my main project is continuing to think of and create easy-to-follow, very accessible computer science
 tutorials for younger students. I hope to convey fun projects in a very creative and interesting way. Also, as
  another project on the side, I am in the process of creating a cooking page with a collage of pictures of all of
   the food I have made with links to the original recipes.
