Recently, I received super cool led lights that came with a Wireless Smart Controller which allows me to control the lights by an app or Amazon Echo. In this post I will be highlighting some features that I do and don't like.

<b>packaging:</b>


<b>adhesiveness:</b>

This was the only part that I was not completely satisfied with. Although the light strip itself was advertised to come with a very adhesive backing, it did not end up sticking well to the wall. The tape backing on the strip was extremely sticky, but the strip itself was not as much. When placing it on my wall, I went a couple meters with the tape backing, however it started peeling off as I continued. Ultimately, I used dots of hot glue on the back in order to give extra support (this ended up working quite well).
