Recently, I received super cool led lights that came with a Wireless Smart Controller which allows me to control the lights by an app or Amazon Echo. In this post I will be highlighting some features that I do and don't like.

<!--more-->

<b>packaging:</b> Packaging was secure and everything was pretty compact. When I opened it the led lights were nicely
 rolled up and
 nothing was frayed or broken.


<b>adhesiveness:</b> This was the only part that I was not completely satisfied with. Although the light strip itself
 was advertised to come with a very adhesive backing, it did not end up sticking well to the wall. The tape backing on the strip was extremely sticky, but the strip itself was not as much. When placing it on my wall, I went a couple meters with the tape backing, however it started peeling off as I continued. Ultimately, I used dots of hot glue on the back in order to give extra support (this ended up working quite well).


<b>connection to amazon echo:</b> This works marvelously and is what makes this specific brand stand out from the
 others. By going into the Amazon Echo
 app and to the add device tab you can easily search the name of the brand and set up your led lights. This allows
  you to ask Amazon alexa to turn on/off your strip lights or even to change colors between Amazon's 16 pre-programmed
   colors.


<b>color customization:</b> Color customization is overall really good as you can pick basically any color on the
 color wheel. However, through
 Amazon alexa you can only ask for 16 different colors. In order to access the rest of the colors, you must go into
  the TuyaSmart app and choose a color from the color wheel.
