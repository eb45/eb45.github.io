This article focuses on the process of assembling and coding the <i>Little Robot Friends</i> kit. I will use pictures
 to walk-through all of the steps from soldering the components together to actually creating a multitude of unique
  programs to run.

<h4>What you need:</h4>
  - Little Robot Friends Kit ([at this link!](https://littlerobotfriends.com/collections/all))
  - soldering iron
  - solder
  - pliers
  - tape
  - multimeter (optional, but very useful!)
  
<h4>Assembling your robot:</h4>
Take all of the components out of the Little Robot Friends kit and set them out on the table. It's really useful to
 see the parts all at once!

![Step #1](/img/step1.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Twirl the metal spring into the holes on the top of your robot's main body. Solder both ends and cut off the excess
 metal. The ends are definitely spiky so using pliers might be a good move. Finally, be patient in screwing it in the
  holes as it is difficult to be forced.

![Step #2](/img/step2.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Pull the two LEDs in the kit carefully through the two eye holes. With only your hands, you will probably only have
 success pulling it about 2/3 of the way through. In order to get the LEDs snug against the board, take a pair of
  pliers and slowly make back and forth motions (pulling and pushing) to pull it completely through. Solder each of
   the leads onto the board. Then when snipping off the excess metal leads make sure to save two for the speaker!

![Step #3](/img/step3.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Add a small blob of solder at the ends of each of the LED leads that you kept. Then attach the prongs to the back of
 the speaker in an X-formation (place them on top of the copper-colored spaces). Once stuck to the speaker, bend the
  two leads with pliers to face upwards. Then, add a dab of glue to the back of the speaker and thread the two prongs
   through the robot's main board through the designated holes. 

![Personality Resistors](/img/personality.png){:class="img-responsive"}
Time to pick out your robot's personalities! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX9o8DZ5A_g) gives a
 good explanation of what resistors correlate to what personality traits. Above are the ones I chose:
1. Happiness (high resistance) - grumpy
2. Chattiness (semi-high resistance) - pretty chatty
3. Humour (low resistance) - ticklish
4. Enthusiasm (medium) - average enthusiasm
5. Neediness (low resistance) - craves attention
6. Bravery (high resistance) - gets scared easily
